    <h1>Transfer Policy & Procedure</h1>
    <p>
Washington University recognizes that staff motivation, productivity, and retention are dependent upon people working in jobs that are well suited to their interests, and therefore offers and encourages transfer opportunities for current employees. Likewise, supervisors should be supportive of staff members who have the desire to enhance their skills or develop new competencies to pursue different or greater responsibilities internally.
<br><br>
An employee must be in his or her current position at least nine (9) months and be in good standing before he or she is eligible to apply for a transfer. The nine-month waiting requirement may be waived if the position is being adversely affected due to a reduction in the work force or job elimination, or if there is significant change in the terms and conditions of employment (e.g. work schedule, hours, salary, status, etc.).
<br><br>
In all cases, the employee’s work record, including but not limited to performance, attendance, efforts to develop skills and related behavior will be used as valid criteria for determining suitability for a position.
<br><br>
In consideration of the above factors, employees are required to provide documentation that supports their performance history, such as the last performance evaluation or letters of reference. For all positions, consideration will be given to the employee’s demonstrated interpersonal skills, among other job-related factors, before making a final decision. Deficiencies in such skills or job-related factors may eliminate an individual from further consideration. 
Exceptions to this policy are reviewed on an individual basis and must be approved by the Office of Human Resources.
